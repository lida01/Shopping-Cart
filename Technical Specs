The technology used is Java J2EE.

The design pattern used is MVC (Model - View - Controller)

Model - POJO (your plain old Java classes)
View - jsp and CSS 
Controller - Servlets

Frontend languages
1. Html and Jsp for page outlet 
2. CSS for styling
3. Javascript and Jquery for validation in Front End

Backend technologies
1. Servlets 
2. POJO classes

So your front end that is rendered on screen is done by the View. When you make a request for anything from the page,<br /> 
your request will be received by the Model (Servlet Container) and will be redirected accordingly. This is called a Servlet request. <br />
The Servlet attends to your request and sends a result back to you, which is called a Servlet Response. <br />
<br />
Servlet can fetch your request in one of the two ways, namely GET and POST. These are called Http methods. <br>
<br />
There is a database used in the backend. It is accessed using an ORM framework called Hibernate.
